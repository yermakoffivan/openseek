# bobzhang/openseek

OpenSeek is a small MoonBit foundation for an OpenAI-compatible coding agent
supporting DeepSeek, Kimi, and Z.AI GLM models. The module is split into pure
data, HTTP transport, agent orchestration, and a CLI entry point so request
encoding can be tested without network access.

For a picture of how the pieces fit together — module architecture, the core
data model, and the life of one agent turn — see
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Monorepo development

The root [`moon.work`](moon.work) develops OpenSeek, its protocol, visualizer,
inspector, and the [`moonbitlang/editor`](editor/README.md) source together.
Desktop owns a separate [`desktop/moon.work`](desktop/moon.work) that adds the
root, protocol, and editor modules as local members. This keeps Proton out of
ordinary CLI builds while Desktop still compiles against the same checkout.
The editor likewise keeps `editor/moon.work` for editor-only work.

A fresh checkout needs the MoonBit toolchain and `just`; `just check` also
requires `jq` to inspect structured compiler diagnostics. The root integration
gates are:

```sh
just check              # native + JS root-workspace checks and formatting
just test               # native + JS root-workspace tests and OpenSeek cram tests
just build              # native + JS root-workspace builds
just desktop-check      # Desktop plus its local module dependencies
just desktop-test       # Desktop workspace tests
just desktop-build      # Desktop workspace builds
just editor-build       # editor web distribution and server
just editor-test        # editor-only tests on every supported target
just editor-test-browser
```

`moon run cmd/openseek` uses only the root workspace and therefore does not
resolve Proton or require CEF, GTK, or X11. A package path below `desktop/`
selects the nested Desktop workspace, so historical commands such as
`moon run ./desktop/package/macos` continue to work from the repository root.

The editor browser suites additionally need Node.js 18 or newer, the locked npm
dependencies, and a Playwright-managed Chromium installation:

```sh
cd editor
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
```

Linux hosts that lack Playwright's system dependencies can use the CI form,
`npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`.

Neither editor reference submodule is needed for the normal build, test, or
browser smoke gates. Initialize CodeMirror only for source-reference research;
initialize VS Code only for the opt-in editor performance suite:

```sh
git submodule update --init editor/codemirror # source-reference research
git submodule update --init editor/vscode     # opt-in performance suite
```

The `deepseek` subpackage is pure and exposes chat data plus JSON helpers:

- `Model` and `Role`
- `ChatMessage(role, content=...)` with strongly typed `Role` values
- `ToolDefinition(name, description, parameters, strict?)` for native tool calls
- `ChatResponse` with `FromJson` response decoding

It has no HTTP dependency and is suitable for blackbox tests and portable
request/response handling.

The `deepseek/client` subpackage exposes the HTTP client:

- `Client(api_key~, model?, api_url?)`
- `Client::chat(messages, tools?)`

It depends on `moonbitlang/async/http` and is native-only.

The `agent_tool` package exposes the local tool registry and typed executor
boundary. Tool executors return `ToolAction`: normal tools use
`Respond(ToolOutput(...))`, while control tools such as `finish` use
`Control(Finish(...))`.

The `agent_runtime` package owns loop-scoped task-group access and an extensible
event queue available to stateful tools.

The `agent_session` package owns typed durable conversation state, append-only
session events, JSON round-tripping, and projection from a session into
DeepSeek chat messages. It is separate from TUI transcript rendering so
resumable sessions can be type-safe and process-independent. The native
`agent_session/store` package persists those sessions as a small header plus an
append-only JSONL event log.

The `agent` subpackage contains the OpenSeek agent loop, native DeepSeek
tool-call handling, and local tool dispatch. It depends on `deepseek/client`,
filesystem, and process APIs.

## Agent CLI

The `cmd/openseek` package is the single-binary entry point — a subcommand tree
(default: the terminal UI; `run`/`serve`/`review`/`sessions` for the headless
engine; `mcp` to validate MCP configuration). `openseek run` parses arguments
and runs the agent package. The agent sends DeepSeek native function tools and
supports eleven local tools: `mbtx` — both the scripting surface and the
command runner, spawning processes through the shell-free
`moonbitlang/async/shell` API, with
`job_output` and `job_stop` watching anything it detaches as a background job —
plus `read`, `edit`, `multi_edit`, `write`, `remove`, `plan`, `goal`, and
`finish`. There is no shell tool, so no command ever goes through a shell.

```bash
export DEEPSEEK=sk-...
moon run cmd/openseek -- run "inspect this project and finish with a short summary"
```

For Kimi models, set `KIMI` instead:

```bash
export KIMI=sk-...
moon run cmd/openseek -- --model kimi-k2.7-code-highspeed run "inspect this project"
```

For Z.AI GLM models, set `GLM`:

```bash
export GLM=...
moon run cmd/openseek -- --model glm-5.3 run "inspect this project"
```

`OPENSEEK_MODEL` is optional and defaults to `deepseek-v4-pro`.
`OPENSEEK_MAX_STEPS` is optional; when omitted, turns are bounded by the
model's context window (a checkpoint summary carries each turn into the
next) rather than a step count. Pass `--max-steps` to cap steps for one run.
`--thinking no|high|max` controls thinking mode and effort (default: max); GLM
maps `no` to its lowest supported effort because GLM 5.3 always reasons.
Pass `--dir <workspace>` to run one-shot commands against another workspace
while still launching from the current shell. The default is `.`; if the final
directory component is missing and its parent exists, OpenSeek creates it and
logs `workspace_created`.

## MCP Servers

OpenSeek can use tools from [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers.
Point `--mcp-config` (or `OPENSEEK_MCP_CONFIG`) at a JSON file in the de-facto
standard shape — an existing Claude/Cursor-style `mcp.json` works as-is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codex": { "command": "codex", "args": ["mcp-server"] },
    "remote": { "url": "https://example.com/mcp", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer …" } }
  }
}
```

A `command` entry is launched as a stdio subprocess (in the agent's workspace,
inheriting the environment plus any `env` overrides); a `url` entry speaks the
Streamable HTTP transport. Each server's tools join the agent's registry as
`mcp__<server>__<tool>` for `run`, `serve`, and the TUI (which forwards
`OPENSEEK_MCP_CONFIG` to its engine). A server that fails to start, handshake,
or list its tools is logged and skipped — MCP never breaks a session. Tool
results are size-capped, calls are bounded by a timeout, and tool names are
sanitized to the provider's function-name rules.

Validate a configuration without starting a session:

```bash
moon run cmd/openseek -- mcp --mcp-config mcp.json
```

Resources and prompts (the other MCP capabilities) are not consumed: openseek's
agent is tool-driven, and a server that wants to feed it context can expose a
tool. This keeps the surface small; revisit if a concrete need appears.

## Skills

Reusable markdown playbooks the agent loads on demand. A skill is a
`<name>.md` file or a `<name>/SKILL.md` directory layout with optional
`name:`/`description:` frontmatter. Two libraries are merged: the global one
(`~/.openseek/skills`, or `--global-skills-dir`) and the workspace one
(`.openseek/skills`), with workspace skills shadowing same-named global ones.
The system prompt lists each skill's name, description, and file path; the
agent reads the file before applying it. See `agent_skill/README.mbt.md`.

## Terminal UI

The terminal UI is the **default** mode of the single `openseek` binary (the
`cmd/tui` library, also reachable as `openseek tui`): a scrolling transcript with
a live composer. It spawns the `openseek` engine (by default this same binary in
`serve` mode) and renders its JSONL event stream — streamed answer text appears
live on the activity line, and each turn's reasoning is kept as a dim `✻`
transcript aside above its answer.

```bash
export DEEPSEEK=sk-...
moon run cmd/openseek -- tui
```

**Every launch converses in a durable session.** The engine only carries
context between prompts through the session store, so the UI generates a session
id per launch (`tui-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm`, named in the startup banner) and stores
the conversation under `--session-root` (default `.openseek/`). Follow-up prompts
remember earlier ones, and a conversation outlives the process:

- `moon run cmd/openseek -- tui --continue` resumes the most recently active session.
- `moon run cmd/openseek -- tui --session <id>` resumes (or creates) a specific one.
- `moon run cmd/openseek -- sessions list` shows what is resumable —
  tab-separated id, last-activity time, and the session's first prompt,
  newest first.

See each package README for API boundaries, examples, and package-specific test
notes.

## Verified CLI Documentation (cram)

The CLI behaviour is documented as executable cram tests under `tests/`, built
and run with `moon cram test`. The wrapper compiles the native `cmd/*` packages
and exposes each on `PATH` as `<name>.exe` (e.g. `openseek.exe`).

- [`tests/cram/cli.md`](tests/cram/cli.md) — offline `openseek` subcommand
  examples (top-level and `run` help, and the `run`/`serve`/`sessions` behaviors).
  They make no network calls and run in CI via `moon cram test tests/cram`.
- [`tests/cram/tui.md`](tests/cram/tui.md) — offline `openseek tui` examples (the
  help banner and the missing-API-key error). The argument parser runs before the
  terminal UI starts, so these need no API key and no TTY.
- [`tests/cram/subrun.md`](tests/cram/subrun.md) — the offline internal child-mode
  wire contract: JSON input on stdin, JSONL events on stdout, typed reports, and
  failure-event delivery. It uses the modelless `echo` kind and needs no API key.
- [`tests/live/deepseek.md`](tests/live/deepseek.md) — a real, non-mock DeepSeek
  round trip. It is opt-in (`DEEPSEEK=sk-... moon cram test tests/live`) and
  parses the agent's JSONL log with MoonBit itself: a `moon run -e` script reads
  the stream through the published [`bobzhang/jsonl`](https://mooncakes.io/docs/bobzhang/jsonl)
  package and asserts on typed `Json` values — no `jq` — without pinning
  nondeterministic content such as token counts or model phrasing.

For the evaluation-backed roadmap, see
[`agent-improvement-guide.md`](agent-improvement-guide.md). It explains why the
next highest-ROI work is semantic CLI validation, native CLI/error-handling
guidance, MoonBit command routing, shaped IDE output, and manifest/debug/edit
guardrails.

The file-editing eval harness is available under `eval/file_edit`. It runs the
real agent against isolated fixtures and checks exact final file state, making
it suitable for cheap Flash baselines such as 8 successful edits out of 10.

The deterministic tool harness under `eval/tool_harness` exercises each built-in
tool through `agent_tool.execute_tool_call` with temporary fixtures. It is meant
for ordinary `moon test` coverage of tool wiring and observable side effects,
not for model quality scoring.

The `testkit/filesystem` package provides reusable JSON-backed text fixtures for
mock tests and evals. It materializes flat path-to-content JSON objects under a
temporary root and compares listed files against disk.
